i have slowly progressed this week, starting work on a kicad design to properly hold all the components

its an inbstersting peice of software and slightly annoying trying to find blueprints and compnents that match to the ones ive bought.
in the end i have gained some exsperince in creating my own componets throuhg reading the hardware dimension specs (this was just for buttons, and 2d analog joysticks)

once i got all the components into the schematic, i did a bit of work to get it into the pcb, while also looseing all the footprints i made due to makeing them global instead of project spesific.
the pcbs are on thier way and were way cheaper than i was exspeciting for a custom design

this is the very simple schematic, everything is powered from the picos 3v3 pin, but i think this will be alright as everything uses 3.3v to operate and shouldnt draw enough current to opeverload it
if you have any suggestions please let me know as this is all very new to me.
