i have slowly progressed this week, starting work on a kicad desing to properly hold all the components

its an inbstersting peice of software and slightly annoying trying to find blueprints and compnents that m atch to the ones ive bought.
in the end i have gained some exsperince in creating my own componets throuhg reading the hardware dimension specs (this was just for buttons, and 2d analog joysticks)

now that i have gotten all the right components onto the schematics the next step will be to create the actual blueprint for the pcb. this will be an exciting step as i will start to see the actual process into routing the traces properly

this is the very simple schematic, everything is powered from the pico 3v3 pin, but i think this will be alright as everything uses 3.3v to operate and doesnt draw enough current to opeverload it(hopefully)
if you have any suggestions please let me know as this is all very new to me.
